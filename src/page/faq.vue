        INTRODUCTION TO CHAIN TOUR
      </span>
      <div class="context">
        Clash of clans is a strategic chain game developed by the development team of supercell oy, a Finnish game
        company. Supercell oy is a game studio established by ilkka paananen and five other co founders in 2010,
        headquartered in Finland. In November 2012, the company surpassed EA and became the game publisher with the
        largest revenue in the app store, relying on only two games: hay day and clash of clans. Among them, Clash of
        clans has occupied the top three positions in the app store game revenue ranking for more than half a year.
        Relying only on two mobile games, the company's revenue increased rapidly from $700000 a month to $2.5 million a
        day, setting a precedent for mobile game developers. In 2021, the team decided to launch the chain tour version
        to welcome the future meta universe world and jointly create the meta universe infrastructure.

      </span>
      <div class="context">
        Co founders: Mikko kodisoja, Niko derome, visa forsten, Lassi leppinen and Petri styrman. The six co founders
        are senior people in the game industry and have worked in large companies such as digital chocolate and remedy.
        They have launched more than 165 games on 12 platforms. They have a common background, so they decided to
        jointly create supercell to realize their ideals. Pan Naning said, "we believe that excellent talents create
        excellent games. Our main goal should be to gather such excellent talents and establish a zero bureaucratic
        working environment, which is the inspiration for us to establish supercell.". "Internally, we often say 'small
        is the new big'," pannanin said. "We are composed of different 'cells', and the operation of each small team is
        very independent.". "The team decides what they want to do by themselves. We measure them by the results. There
        is no special management process between companies. We do this to maximize efficiency.". "We are very
        transparent and open, sharing data with everyone, every day. We have a high degree of trust among our members,
        and this way of working needs trust very much.".
